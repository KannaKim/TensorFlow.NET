This is more general than the crop_to_bounding_box op which extracts a fixed size slice from the input image and does not allow resizing or aspect ratio change.
            /// Returns a tensor with crops from the input image at positions defined at the bounding box locations in boxes.The cropped boxes are all resized(with bilinear or nearest neighbor interpolation) to a fixed size = [crop_height, crop_width].The result is a 4 - D tensor[num_boxes, crop_height, crop_width, depth].The resizing is corner aligned. In particular, if boxes = [[0, 0, 1, 1]], the method will give identical results to using tf.image.resize_bilinear() or tf.image.resize_nearest_neighbor() (depends on the method argument) with align_corners = True.

A normalized coordinate value of y is mapped to the image coordinate at y * (image_height - 1), so as the [0, 1] interval of normalized image height is mapped to [0, image_height - 1] in image height coordinates. We do allow y1 > y2, in which case the sampled crop is an up-down flipped version of the original image. The width dimension is treated similarly.
